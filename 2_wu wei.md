# Wu wei

The second pillar of my values is **wu wei**.

Wu wei means acting without forcing. Western culture often promotes assertiveness, encouraging people to achieve their goals by molding the world around them to fit what they want. Daoism, on the other hand, encourages acting when the time is right and harnessing the circumstances you're given. It's not about inaction or passivity, but rather acting in harmony with the world as a more effective means of achieving goals within your limits.

This is closely related to another Eastern concept, yin and yang. This represents opposing yet codependent forces, neither of which can really be considered "good" or "evil". Both are necessary and contain a part of each other. When encountering obstacles in life (including those we might be tempted to categorize as "evil"), wu wei means not pushing against them but working around them. Be like water, which erodes rock more effectively than force. This is difficult to master - as engineers, we often want to impose our rules and instructions on the world in order to derive the exact outcome we want. But even computers don't always work this way (much less humans) - there will always be annoying compiler errors, unsafe inputs, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and imprecision in clarifying both the problems and the desired outcomes. Wu wei tells us to acknowledge these things as a fact of life, diminish them when possible, and work around them when they're inevitable.

Wu wei is deeply embedded in my moral system, which is intended to respect and harness the balance of the world rather than beat it into submission. These pillars are not hardline rules, but counterbalancing forces that keep each other in check.
