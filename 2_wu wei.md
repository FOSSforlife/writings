# Wu wei

The second pillar of my values is **wu wei**.

Wu wei means acting without forcing. Western culture often promotes assertiveness, encouraging people to achieve their goals by molding the world around them. Daoism, on the other hand, encourages acting when the time is right and harnessing the circumstances you're given. It's not about inaction or passivity, but rather acting in harmony with the world.

This is closely related to another Eastern concept, yin and yang. This represents opposing yet codependent forces (sometimes meant as "good and evil", but this is an oversimplification). When encountering difficulties in live, wu wei requires seeing them not as obstacles to push against but as energy to work with. This is a difficult practice - as engineers, we often want to impose our rules and instructions on the world in order to derive the exact outcome we want. But even computers don't always work this way - there will always be annoying compiler errors, unsafe inputs, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and imprecision in clarifying both the problems and the desired outcomes. Wu wei tells us to acknowledge these things as a fact of life, diminish them when possible, and work around them when they're inevitable.
