# Simplicity

In 2011, Rich Hickey, creator of the Clojure programming language, gave a famous talk titled ["Simple Made Easy"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4). In his talk, he defined "simple" as the opposite of complex (systems unnecessarily tangled together and reliant on one another) and "easy" meaning something that a user or developer can quickly pick up and use without trouble. He makes the argument that many programming abstractions, with the intention of making things easy for the developer, actually make the underlying system difficult to understand and debug, costing time and energy for everyone in the long run. This is why we should value simplicity.

This is a valuable observation, not just for developing software, but also for using software. It's not quite the UNIX philosophy of "each application does one thing and does it well" - lots of applications do many things well - but rather about using tools that are reilable, interoperable, composable, and ideally work across devices.

Simplicity can be applied to every aspect of life. In fact, this collection of texts that you're looking at is the result of me wanting to make _blogging_ more simple (after trying Medium, Substack, Ghost, WriteFreely, Notion, Quartz, and Obsidian Publish). It's just some Markdown files, hosted on a website that I don't have to build, maintain, or style, written in a format where I don't feel any pressure to consistently provide updates or "market" myself. Is it flashy, interactive, engaging? No. But it _works_, because it's _simple_.

## Tools I Use

### Obsidian

This is my favorite app of all time. At its core, it is just a nice-looking WYSIWYG Markdown text editor. But once you understand its simple primitives - tags, wikilinks, and properties - you can transform it into a powerhouse. I use it as a second brain

- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows, iOS, Android
- **Reliability:** Unfortunately it is not open source, so technically it could become abandonware and no one would be able to carry on its legacy (at least not in the form of its codebase). However, development is highly unlikely to stop anytime soon. There's a passionate community around it, the lead developer Steph Ango cares a lot about the project, and the team seems to be making good money via their Sync and Publish services and through donations. Plus, worst case scenario, you can just use a different Markdown editor! You can't say the same for data stored in Google Docs, Notion, or Apple Notes.
- **Composability:** Again, It's just Markdown, so you can use any tool alongside it (or build your own) to edit or analyze your files in any way you like. The pages in this repo were written in Markdown files using both Obsidian and Visual Studio Code, and uploaded directly to GitHub. No APIs, no file conversions, no hassle.
- **Security:** It's not open source, which would be ideal for inspecting whether our data (including personal notes!) are being sent anywhere. However, I feel at ease knowing that the company has proudly passed multiple [independent security audits](https://obsidian.md/security). They're not an ad company like Microsoft or Google, so there's not much incentive to harvest your data.
- **Ethics:** Not made by an evil company.
- **An interesting balance:** You'll notice that Obsidian is not open source but still doesn't lock you into its ecosystem. Capitalistic yet kind. This is the sweet spot between the _idealism_ of [Universal Compassion](<1_universal compassion.md>) and the _practicality_ of [Stability](stability.md).

### Jellyfin

Unfortunately, because there are no digital movie storefronts that offer DRM-free titles, and because bypassing copy protections on DVDs and Blu-Rays that I own is [illegal in the United States](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap12.html#1201), and because GitHub's guidelines prohibit the promotion of piracy, I don't actually use Jellyfin at all. Please move on to the next section.
