# Hegel's Dialectic

German philosopher Hegel described a process by which an original idea (the **thesis**), will often spawn its rival (the **antithesis**), and the ensuing battle of ideas and contradictions between the two results in a unifying **synthesis** between them. I believe that this can be a useful lens for analyzing cultural movements.
