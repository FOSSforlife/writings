# Attunement

The third pillar of my values is **Attunement**.

Balancing out the other values which are more "macro", Attunement is all about "micro". While it's useful to abstract our understanding of the world into formal systems, it's important to remember that our experiences are analog, not digital. When you treat humans as machines with predictable outputs, your calculations will inevitably contain some degree of error. But when you train yourself to shut off your inner dialogue for a moment, observe, and listen to others without judgement, you will discover valuable insights that can either be factored into your equations, or in some cases transcend quantification entirely.
