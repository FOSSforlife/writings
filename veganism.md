# Veganism

As I hinted at in the intro to Universal Compassion, my compassion extends to all sentient life that is capable of suffering. There is immense animal suffering that goes on in the factory farms that mass-produce our meat, dairy, and eggs, and the only reason it is produced through such harmful cost-cutting measures is because of _market demand_. Whenever we purchase a product, we contribute to the market demand of that product.

## Why not vegetarian/reduceitarian/flexitarian/vegan except for cheese?

I think this is fine for people who can't go vegan for health reasons, rare personal circumstances, or if you feel like you are seriously at capacity for the amount of good you want to do in the world (which is fine because everyone has their own limit - I am against purity testing).

For everyone else, here are some reasons why I think this is a bad idea:

1. [Act utilitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_utilitarianism) defenses (e.g. it's okay just this one time!) fail for the same reason that act utilitarianism in general fails: it encourages faulty observations at best ([for example, "cage-free" is a misleading label](https://veganfta.com/blog/2025/07/14/%F0%9F%A5%9A-the-dark-truth-about-egg-production-why-cage-free-isnt-enough/)), motivated reasoning at worst (and most common).
2.
