# Universal Compassion

The first pillar of my values is **Universal Compassion**.

When making decisions, our moral circle should include as many humans (and other sentient beings) as is reasonable given the circumstances.

It is the opposite of tribalism and egoism. It is also the antidote to _selective empathy_, where one only includes in their moral circle those who they find relatable, or those whose stories are the most emotionally impactful. Empathy is a good and natural part of the human experience, as it helps us connect to one another. However, empathy alone does not tell us who is most in need of help. Therefore, to help ensure fairness and equality, the best path is to be attuned to our cognitive biases and train ourselves to be aware of suffering wherever it exists, using data and evidence where possible, not just narratives and heuristics.
