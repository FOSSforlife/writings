# Stability

The fourth pillar of my values is **Stability**.

In order for any of my values to persist through time, it is necessary to encode them into structures, routines, and guardrails. If [Optimism](6_optimism.md) is yang, then Stability is the yin that prevents it from moving too fast and breaking too many things.

Next pillar: [Clarity](5_clarity.md)
