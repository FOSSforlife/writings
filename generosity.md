# Generosity

Everyone has a selfish side and a generous side. Generosity can be measured in terms of willingness to sacrifice. Some people exist at the extremes (mostly selfish or mostly generous), but it’s rare and probably unhealthy. The vast majority of people “mean well” (as in, they wish for others to be happy), to the point where saying this about someone is a redundant and meaningless statement. In encouraging people to do better, or determining who we should team up with in our moral pursuits, the metric by which we “judge” (for lack of a better word) others should be: are they exercising their generous side (in a way that is sacrificial and therefore genuine), and how egalitarian (non-tribal) are they in doing so.
