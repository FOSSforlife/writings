# Optimism

The sixth pillar of my values is **Optimism**.

Optimism fuels the engine of civilization, encouraging us to never stop dreaming of a better future and to take the steps to make it happen. One might argue that you shouldn't be optimistic or pessimistic, only realistic. But the world is deeply uncertain, and the assumptions we make given limited information play a major role in shaping our actions. Even when the odds are slim, we maximize those odds through hope, creativity, and hard work.
