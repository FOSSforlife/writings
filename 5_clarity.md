# Clarity

The fifth pillar of my values is **Clarity**.

This means two things:

- Attempting to be as accurate as possible in your observations
- Speaking so that others can understand you

The second is in service of the first - when you speak clearly, you increase the rate and quality of facts being communicated to others, helping them also make more accurate observations.

The writings I've posted here are deliberately written in a logical way, intended for an audience that appreciates precision. This promotes Clarity by enabling me to be explicit in my assumptions, statements, and conclusions.

Clarity protects the other pillars from becoming delusion, motivated reasoning, and projection. It ensures that when you come up with solutions, you are as sure as you can reasonably be about their effectiveness, and that any failure becomes new data for creating better solutions in the future.
