# Clarity

The fifth pillar of my values is **Clarity**.

This means two things:

- Attempting to be as accurate as possible in your observations
- Speaking so that others can understand you

The second is in service of the first - when you speak clearly, you spread both **more accurate** knowledge and more **accurate knowledge** (read that a few times if you need to).
