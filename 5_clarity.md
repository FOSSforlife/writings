# Clarity

The fifth pillar of my values is **Clarity**.

This means two things:

- Attempting to be as accurate as possible in your observations
- Speaking so that others can understand you

The second is in service of the first - when you speak clearly, you spread both **more accurate** knowledge and more **accurate knowledge** (read that a few times if you need to).

The writings I've posted here are deliberately written in a logical way, intended for an audience that appreciates precision. This promotes Clarity by enabling me to be explicit in my assumptions, statements, and conclusions.

Next pillar: [Optimism](6_optimism.md)
