# Walking

I try to get at least 10,000 steps in every day. Walking helps me slow down, process my thoughts, and soak in the essence of the world around me. This can easily be done no matter if your environment is urban, suburban, or rural, and it's worth doing even if it elicits strange looks from people in car-centered areas. In fact, observing small details in your environment can attune you to the beauty that exists in all of our surroundings, even ones that at first glance seem cold or utilitarian.

Walking spurs creativity by reducing activity in the brain's default mode network (the part of you that's overly introspective and painfully analyzes every detail about your life) and by giving us a break from the overstimulation of work, responsibilities, and the internet. Being outside makes you put everything into perspective - your sense of physical space, the passage of time, identity, life goals. It teaches you think of every moment not as a utility function but rather as something to experience and be aware of. Insights flow naturally from this state of being, rather than having to be forced out of your brain through intense concentration.
